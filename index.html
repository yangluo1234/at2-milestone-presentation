        <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
        <p>
          The project <strong>Sound Constellation</strong> responds to the
          creative prompt “No Text Characters”. The idea is to design an
          interface that allows users to explore sound without relying on text
          labels. Instead, the project uses stars and constellations as visual
          metaphors. Users connect stars on a grid to form patterns, and each
          pattern produces a sequence of musical notes. This method transforms
          drawing into an act of composition, encouraging exploration through
          both sight and sound.
        </p>

        <p>
          The choice of a constellation theme is not only aesthetic but also
          functional. Stars provide a clear and universal symbol that can guide
          users without text, while the lines between stars make feedback
          immediate and intuitive. The interface design relies on simple but
          effective cues, such as brightness and motion, to signal that an
          action has been recognised. This ensures that the UI remains
          accessible and engaging, even for first-time users.

        <h2>Visual Plan / Sketch</h2>
        <img src="AT2-plan_3.png" alt="Visual Plan Sketch" />
        <p>
          The Visual plan sketches show how stars, playback controls, and sound
          effects work together as one system. Inspiration comes from projects
          such as Chrome Music Lab (<a
            href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Experiments"
            target="_blank"
            >https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Experiments</a
          >), which demonstrates how minimal visuals and playful interaction can
          create meaningful experiences. Sound Constellation applies a similar
          idea, allowing users to express their creativity by interacting with
          the interface and generating unique, beautiful sounds.

        <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
        <img src="SystemMap.png" alt="System Map" />
        <p>
          The system is built with Tone.js PolySynth as the main sound engine.
          Each star in the grid is linked to a musical note. When a user clicks
          on a star, a single note is triggered and stored in an array. By
          connecting several stars, the user forms a constellation path that
          represents a sequence of notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the <strong>Play</strong> button is pressed, the system plays the
          stored notes one by one. The <strong>Math.random()</strong> function
          is applied to introduce a slight variation of each note. This makes
          every playback sound a little different, which creates a more natural
          and playful experience. At the same time, the background colour is
          also changed using <strong>Math.random()</strong>, so every sequence
          has a unique visual identity in addition to its sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Reset</strong> button clears all stored notes and visual
          connections, allowing users to start a new constellation.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Please try to connect a sequence of stars and then play it back.
              Without text labels, should you first draw a path and then press
              the play button? Did the icons for play' and 'reset' make sense to
              you?
            </li>
            <li>
              After pressing play, did the sound and the visuals match what you
              expected from the constellation you drew? Was the random variation
              in playback noticeable, and did it make the interaction feel fun
              or confusing?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did the background colour change or other visual effects help you
              notice that your action was successful? Would you like to add more
              effects, such as a filter or delay, to make the interaction
              clearer?
            </li>

          <h3>Feedback Summary</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Controls:</strong> Most users found the interface
              intuitive and easy to understand without text labels. The Play and
              Reset buttons made sense, although a few users forgot to press
              Play at first and only connected the stars. Some confusion was
              mentioned about the slider, which looked like a volume control.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Sound & Playback:</strong> The sounds were described as
              fun, pleasant, and well-matched to the constellation theme. The
              reverb effect was appreciated, but the random variation was not
              always noticed. Some users suggested adding more sound effects
              (such as delay or filter changes) to make the audio richer.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> The background colour change was
              seen as a fun addition, but not everyone noticed it clearly. A few
              participants suggested making the connecting lines more obvious or
              adding extra dynamic effects, like twinkling stars or a
              galaxy-like background. Others felt the current visuals were
              already sufficient.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            The peer feedback provided several useful insights into the
            strengths and areas for improvement in my project. Most users agreed
            that the interface was straightforward to understand. They mentioned
            that connecting stars and pressing the play button was intuitive,
            even without text labels. This means that the design choice of using
            only icons for play and reset was successful in supporting the
            creative prompt of “No Text Characters”.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, some users expressed minor confusion about the slider
            and its function. While the reverb effect was noticeable, several
            participants mentioned that the impact was subtle, and they
            suggested adding clearer or more noticeable effects, such as delay
            or audio filters. Furthermore, the background change was not always
            strong enough to indicate success. Some users proposed additional
            visual feedback, such as brighter connecting lines or twinkling
            effects, to reinforce the interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the peer feedback suggests that the main interaction of
            drawing constellations and hearing them played back works well and
            creates a playful and engaging experience. However, to strengthen
            the clarity and impact, I plan to refine the visual and audio
            feedback. This includes trying with stronger background changes,
            more dynamic line animations, and adding an extra sound effect
            option. These adjustments will make the interaction feel more
            responsive while still maintaining the playful style for my project.
