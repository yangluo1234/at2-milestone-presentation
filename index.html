        <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
        <p>
          My chosen creative prompt is “No text characters”. The concept of my
          prototype, Sound Constellation, is to let users create short melodies
          by connecting stars into constellations. Instead of relying on text,
          the interface uses visual metaphors such as glowing stars,
          constellation lines, and common icons(play, reset, reverb) to guide
          interaction. The aim is to make the interface intuitive, like drawing
          on the night sky, while sound feedback and random background colour
          changes add surprise and playfulness. The constellation imagery also
          reflects the theme of mapping and imagination into sound.
